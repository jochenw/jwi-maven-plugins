# The JWI Maven plugins

Over the years, I found that there is a Maven plugin for basically **everything**. However, on occasion, I notice, that there is none, which really fits my purpose. Or, it is too complicated to reaaly understand, and control. Or, I don't like the author. Or, the plugin is painted in pink. ;-)

For whatever reason, sometimes I just want to have a really simple plugin, that does it's job exactly, like I want it. And, being the know-it-all, and opinionated cunt, that I am, the best way to get that is: Do it yourself.

On the other hand, I have learned over the decades, that it makes sense, to preserve such things, because they have a tendency to be useful again. So, that's the reason to start the *JWI Maven Plugins*: A collection of small tools, ASL 2.0 licensed, that I have no intention to formally maintain, or document, but will offer via Maven central for general use. Feel free to use them, feel free to report bugs, or feature requests, but do not expect a response. (I **did** mention, that I am a cunt, didn't I?)

The collection starts with the [JWI Groovy Maven Plugin](#the-jwi-groovy-maven-plugin).

## The JWI Groovy Maven Plugin

This plugin was created, because I couldn't get either of the available Groovy Maven plugins to work: They are either outdated, or don't work as expected (for me, that is). At one point I decided, that it will be less time to write my own than continue to experiment. And, in particular, writing my own would come with guaranteed success.

If you are interested in using this plugin, use the [plugins README](./jwigrv-maven-plugin/README.md).
